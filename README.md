The project is a system for managing the registration and allotment of classrooms for lectures and examinations for a college or university. It is designed to maintain student data such as their name, enrollment number, and courses taken, as well as course data such as the number of students taking the course and the slot assigned to that course.

The system has features/functions such as adding a student to the student-list, deleting a student from the student-list, adding a course to the course list, and allotting classrooms for lectures and exams. When adding a student to the student-list, the system ensures that the student cannot take two courses in the same slot. When deleting a student, the system also deletes the student record from the courses taken by that student. Similarly, when deleting a course, the system ensures that no student has taken that course.

The system uses an optimal way of allotting classrooms for lectures such that the capacity of the room is larger than the number of students registered for the course. It also ensures that two courses in the same slot get different rooms. Additionally, the system tries to use the same room for consecutive slots for students of the same class/semester as much as possible. If it is not possible, then different rooms can be utilized. If a room cannot be allocated to some course in a particular slot, the system ensures that the least number of courses are not allocated the rooms and these courses together have as few students as possible.

For examination allotment, the seats in the classroom are numbered based on row-number, bench-number, etc. The system ensures that no students of the same course can be assigned adjacent seats.

Finally, the system allows for the printing of the list of students and the exam seat allotted to each student for a given slot. This feature enables the faculty to have easy access to the information they need to conduct lectures and exams effectively.

Overall, the system helps to streamline the process of managing the registration and allotment of classrooms for lectures and exams, making it more efficient and effective for both faculty and student
